    <p> You have probably heard about a convoluted fight in Congress over the budget bill, which goes by numerous names: the reconciliation bill, the budget, the Build Back Better Act, or S. Con. Res. 14, if you’re into that. Perhaps the easiest way to identify it is by its price tag: $3.5 trillion. </p>
    <p> The reconciliation bill is not just a bill, School House Rock-style. It is Congress’ annual budget resolution, which cannot be stalled by filibuster in the Senate. Without that obstacle, legislation is easier to pass in a divided Congress. For this reason, majority leaders (Democrats, in this case) throw elements of their agenda into the budget bill, via a process called reconciliation. </p>
    <p> To begin this process, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) sent a <a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/MEMORANDUM%20for%20Democratic%20Senators%20-%20FY2022%20Budget%20Resolution.pdf"> memo</a> to Senate Democrats on Aug. 9, allocating amounts from the overall budget to various congressional committees — that’s $3.5 trillion among them. Schumer instructed the committees on how to spend that money. The committees drafted policies based on the amounts allocated. And just like that, the annual budget is numerous progressive policies in one neat, giant package. </p>
    <p> The snag is that at $3.5 trillion, the bill will never pass. </p>
    <p> On Wednesday, President Biden <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-business-congress-f6fc8e4ea79642a7e04e28211c00db9a?user_email_address=0e2d5db950bf24fe1aaaba2bda41be54&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Oct06_MorningWire&utm_term=Morning%20Wire%20Subscriber"> conceded</a> that the $3.5 trillion would be reduced to somewhere between $1.9 trillion and $2.3 trillion. So, it’s back to the drawing board to see where cuts will be made. </p>
    <p> Still, the $3.5 trillion bill was an ambitious plan for sweeping progressive policies. Until we know what will make it into the next draft, it’s worth taking a look at what Biden and congressional Democrats hope to achieve during their time in power. Here is a breakdown of that $3.5 trillion. </p>
